Welcome to this terrible website. It has been made by the one and only Sam. I will be adding some random junk in the future.

## About Me

I'm a dumbass that makes terrible programs the only work about 20% of the time. I have a yube of the tube channel though if
you would like to see it click [Here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQxJot0hoe2tS5yyt5H28qA). That's about all you need to
know about me.

## Projects

At the moment I'm working on a shitty survival game on Roblox as well as a Garfield battle royale in unity. But I will most likely
just do what I always do and start a project without ever finishing is.

## Some Recommendations

Some good shows are Impractical Jokers, WKUK, and anything with Nathan Barnatt. Some good movies are Tropic Thunder and The Platform.

## Contact

If you'd like to get in contact with me for some reason or another to bad. I don't trust the internet so fuck off.
